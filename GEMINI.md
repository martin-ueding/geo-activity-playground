# LLM Instructions

These are the instructions for an LLM coding agent like Gemini.

This project is a Flask application that uses SQLAlchemy for persistence.

Use modern Python syntax with type annotations.

Don't try to generate Alembic migrations by hand. Just let me run the migration generation script myself.

This project is i18n'ed. Use `_(…)` for user facing strings.

If similar functionality already exist, please asks me to generalize it before creating duplicated code.

Do not run the tests, I will run them.
