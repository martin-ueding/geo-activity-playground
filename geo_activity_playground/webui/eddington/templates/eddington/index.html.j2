        <p>Your Eddington number is <b>{{ eddington_number }}</b>.</p>

        <p>That means that on {{ eddington_number }} separate days you
            have recorded activities exceeding {{ eddington_number }} km. Going far is one thing, going often is
            another. But going far often is hard. Also if you increment the Eddington number, all days with less
            distance will not count any more. It becomes increasingly hard to increment the Eddington number because you
            don't only need to achieve a higher count, but all shorter activities don't count towards the bigger number.
