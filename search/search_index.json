Still I've created the plot from the given data.</p> <p></p> <p>More interesting regarding the heart rate are the zones which one has spent time during this activity.</p> <p></p> <p>The definition of the heart rate zones is not standardized. Usually there are five zones and they have the same names. What differs is how their ranges are computed and there is some chaos around that.</p> <p>All definitions that I found take the maximum heart rate as the upper limit. One can measure this as part of a professional training or just use the 220 minus age prescription which at least for me matches close enough. What they differ on is how they use a lower bound. It seems that Polar or REI basically use 0 as the lower bound. My Garmin system also uses 0 as the lower bound. But as one can see in this blog, one can also use the resting heart rate as the lower bound.</p> <p>Based on the maximum and resting heart rate we will then compute the heart rate zones using certain percentages of effort. We can compute the heart rate as the following:</p> <p>rate = effort \u00d7 (maximum \u2013 minimum) + minimum</p> <p>The zones then take the following efforts:</p> Zone Effort Training 1 50 to 60 % Warmup/Recovery 2 60 to 70 % Base Fitness 3 70 to 80 % Aerobic Endurance 4 80 to 90 % Anerobic Capacity 5 90 to 100 % Speed Training <p>You can decide how you want to do work with that. If you want to have the same definitions that say Garmin uses, you need to just enter your birth year and we can compute the rest. If you want to use a lower bound, you need to specify that.</p> <p>For this create a configuration file at <code>Playground/config.toml</code> and enter a stanza in there, like this:</p> <pre><code>[heart]\nbirthyear = 19..\n</code></pre> <p>If you know your maximum heart rate, you can also write <code>maximum = 187</code>. If you want to use the lower bound, write <code>resting = 48</code> as well.

Apparently he did a lot of rides and had 84 days where he rode at least 84 miles. The Eddington number for cycling was coined from this.</p> <p>If you have an Eddington number E, it means that you have had E days with at least E kilometer distance. At the time of writing my number is 62, which means that I rode at least 62 km on 62 separate days. If I want to extend it to 63, I would need to have at least 63 km on 63 separate days. My bike rides that are just 62 km long will not count any more, making this challenge really hard.</p> <p>In the following plot you can see in blue the number of days that exceed the given distance. You can see that I have a 998 days that exceed 1 km, that's pretty easy when one just records enough data over many years. But then there are only 259 days where I exceed 20 km as this is beyond the distance that I have when I only go for a walk or run some simple errands.</p> <p></p> <p>The red curve indicates how many rides one needs to get the Eddington number. As it is a semi-log plot, the straight line is curved like a log-curve.</p> <p>You can see this cliff at around 80 km. That is the distance that I ride to work and back. I have many days with around 80 km, but longer rides are only on occasional bike trips.

Eddington as a British person used the English mile as a base unit. Therefore his number of 84 is actually harder to achieve than a 84 based on kilometers because he needed to exceed 135 km (84 mi) on each ride.</p> <p>Therefore using a different length unit as a base changes the meaning. The kilometer is easier, the mile (1609.344 m) is harder. One could also use nautical miles (1852 m).

The Open Street Map uses the Web Mercator coordinate system to map from latitude and longitude to pixels on the map.</p> <p>Each tile is 256\u00d7256 pixels in size. The zoom levels zoom in by a factor of two. Therefore all the tiles are organized in a quad tree. As you zoom in, each tile gets split into four tiles which can then show more detail. The following prescription maps from latitude and longitude (given in degrees) to tile indices:</p> <pre><code>def compute_tile(lat: float, lon: float, zoom: int = 14) -&gt; tuple[int, int]:\n    x = np.radians(lon)\n    y = np.arcsinh(np.tan(np.radians(lat)))\n    x = (1 + x / np.pi) / 2\n    y = (1 - y / np.pi) / 2\n    n = 2**zoom\n    return int(x * n), int(y * n)\n</code></pre> <p>At zoom level 14 the tiles have a side length of roughly 1.5 km in Germany. These tiles are used as the basis for explorer tiles. The basic idea is that every tile where you have at least one point in an activity is considered an explored tile.</p> <p>From your activities the program will extract all the tiles that you have visited. And then it does a few things with those. One main thing is that it will display these on an interactive map. When we zoom into one area where I've been on vacation in 2023, you can see the explored tiles there:</p> <p></p> <p>The filled tiles are explored, I have been there. The colored tiles are cluster tiles, that means that all their four neighbor tiles are also explored.</p> <p>You can see here how I have explored a region and ensured that it is mostly contiguous.</p> <p>There is another vacation from 2013 where I wasn't aware of the cluster tiles. I just did some bike trips and didn't look out for the tiles. There the tiles look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>You see all these gaps in there. Also there are three different clusters which are not connected. Each unique cluster is assigned a different color such that one can see where there are gaps between the cluster tiles. And filling the gaps is what the explorer tiles are about: This OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) like craving to fill in the gaps.</p> <p>Let's take a look at my main cluster of explorer tiles. Here I have explored much more than in the areas where I was on vacation.</p> <p></p> <p>You can see an additional feature, the blue square. This is the one largest square which can be fit into all explored tiles. In this picture it has size 21\u00b2. The idea of the square is to have a really tough challenge. Not only does one need to explore increasingly many tiles to expand the square by one unit, there must not be any gaps.</p> <p>As you can see in this picture, there is a tile missing right at the top edge. I will never be able to get that because that is an off-limits area of the German air force at the airport. So I can expand my square to the south only.</p> <p>You can click on each tile and get some information about that particular tile. You can see when you first explored that and with which activity. Also it shows the last activity there as well as the number of activities. If it is a local cluster, it will also show the cluster size.</p> <p></p> <p>There is also the option to color the tiles by first or last visit.

The kind and equipment are extracted from the activity file. If there nothing is found, it defaults to \u201cUnknown\u201d. Using a regular expression with named capture groups one can extract these fields also from the files.

The program will try to search (not match) the whole relative path of the activity to the regular expressions in the order given in the list.
