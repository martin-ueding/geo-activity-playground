# Changelog

This is the log of high-level changes that I have done in the various versions.

## Version 0

This is the pre-release series. Things haven't settled yet, so each minor version might introduce breaking changes.

### Version 0.29

- Use dropdown menus to make navigation a bit smaller.
- [GH-163](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/163): Recompute explorer tiles when there are deleted activities. Previously this would lead to `KeyError` when trying to use the heatmap or the explorer tile maps.
- [GH-161](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/161): Fix explorer tile clusters and square if one has activities that are not to be considered for achievements.
- [GH-164](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/164): Create new function to handle write-and-replace on Windows.
- [GH-155](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/155): Use the same scale for all plots with kind, make this configurable in the settings menu.
- Rewrite the documentation start page to make it more appealing and reflect the work in the web interface.
- [GH-166](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/166): Add map with new explorer tiles to activity view.
- [GH-160](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/160): Update version of `stravalib` and with that also `pydantic`. That fixes a bug with `recursive_guard`.

### Version 0.28

- Add settings menu to suppress fields from share pictures.
- Fix spelling mistake in navigation bar.
- Accelerate the tile visit computation.
- Ignore equipment offsets of equipments that don't exist.
- Reset corrupt heatmap cache files.
- [GH-159](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/159): Improve password mechanism to protect both upload and settings.
- Document the use of Open Street Map uMap for missing explorer tiles on the go.

### Version 0.27

#### Version 0.27.1

- Fix `num_processes` option.

#### Version 0.27.0

- [GH-128](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/128): Let the Strava Checkout importer set the file `strava-last-activity-date.json` which is needed such that the Strava API importer can pick up after all the activities that have been imported via the checkout.
- [GH-143](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/143): Use custom CSV parser to read activities that have newlines in their descriptions.
- [GH-146](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/146): Make multiprocessing optional with `num_processes = 1` in the configuration.
- [GH-147](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/147): Add another safeguard against activities that don't have latitude/longitude data.
- [GH-149](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/149): Only pre-compute explorer maps for zoom 14 and 17 by default. Other ones just have to be enabled once. This saves a bit of computing time for most people that don't need to go down to zoom 19.
- [GH-151](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/151): Do not fail if version cannot be determined.
- Add settings menu where one can configure various things:
  - Equipment offsets
  - Maximum heart rate for heart rate zones
  - Metadata extractions from paths
  - Privacy zones
  - Strava connection
- The `config.json` replaces the `config.toml` and will automatically be generated.
- Fix bug in explorer tile interpolation that likely doesn't have an effect in practice.

### Version 0.26

#### Version 0.26.3

- [GH-142](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/142): Require `pandas >= 2.2.0` to make sure that it knows about `include_groups`.
- [GH-144](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/144): Ignore activities without time series when using the Strava Checkout import.

#### Version 0.26.2

- Start with a test suite for the web server that also tests importing.
  - Already fixed a few little bugs with that.
- [GH-141](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/141): Fix summary page if there are no activities with steps.

#### Version 0.26.1

- [GH-139](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/139), [GH-140](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/140): More fixes for Strava archive importer.

#### Version 0.26.0

- Add automatic dark mode.
- Add some more explanation for the Strava connection.
- [GH-138](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/138): Fix import from Strava archive that was broken in 0.25.0.
- Style the settings page a bit.

### Version 0.25

- Restructure the way that activities are imported to realize a couple of benefits:
  - Deleting activities is detected now, they are removed from the heatmap.
  - If the code is changed, not everything has to be parsed again. This is especially helpful with regard to the rate-limited Strava API.
  - Some code is deduplicated that had accumulated between activity file parsing and the Strava API.
  - Unfortunately it means that everything needs to parsed again into the new format. I'm sorry about that, especially to you Strava users that need to deal with the rate limiting!
- Add an web interface to connect to Strava API using a shared application such that it becomes much simpler to set up.

- [GH-41](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/41): Compute moving time.
- [GH-127](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/127): Make calories and steps optional for the share picture.
- [GH-131](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/131): Update to the column names in the Strava export.
- [GH-133](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/133): Cope with manually recorded activities in Strava export.
- [GH-134](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/134): Cope with broken FIT files.

#### Version 0.21.0

- **Breaking change:** New way to extract metadata from paths and filenames. This uses regular expressions and is more versatile than the heuristic before. If you have used `prefer_metadata_from_file` before, see the [documentation on activity files](../getting-started/using-activity-files.md) for the new way.

- [GH-105](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/105): Ignore similar activities that have vanished.

#### Version 0.19.0

- [GH-88](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/88): Fix confusion about the internal data type for distance. Most of the time it was in meter, but the display was always in kilometer. In order to make it more clear now, the internal data now only contains the field `distance_km` and everything is represented as kilometer internally now.
- Add more tooltip information in the plot on the landing page.
- [GH-87](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/87): Add `prefer_metadata_from_file` configuration option.

- Add option `--skip-strava` to the `serve` command in order to start the webserver without reaching out to Strava first. This might be useful if the rate limit has been exceeded.
- [GH-89](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/89): Refactor some paths into a module such that there are not so many redundant definitions around.
- [GH-86](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/86): Attempt to also read Strava exports that are localized to German, though untested.
- [GH-36](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/36): Add a square planner.

### Version 0.18

- Localize SimRa files to local time zone. [GH-80](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/80)
- Parse speed unit from FIT file. There are many devices which record in m/s and not in km/h, yielding too low speeds in the analysis. This is now fixed. [GH-82](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/82)
- Skip `.DS_Store` files in the activity directory. [GH-81](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/81)
- From FIT files we also extract the _grade_, _temperature_ and _GPS accuracy_ fields if they are present. There is no analysis for them yet, though. Also extract the workout name, sport and sub-sport fields from FIT files. [GH-81](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/81)
