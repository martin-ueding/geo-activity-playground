## Version 1.10.0 — 2025-10-12

Added:

- Clusters can be bookmarked in order to allow explorer tile fun on vacation or after a move. ([GH-357](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/357))

## Version 1.9.4 — 2025-09-13

Changed:

- File hashes (SHA-256) of activity files will be stored in the database. Activity files with a different path but the same hash will not be imported again. This serves as a deduplication mechanism and also allows for moving activity files after import. This does not deduplicate existing activities. ([GH-330](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/330))

Fixed:

- Make parsing of German Strava CSV header more robust against the addition of new fields. ([GH-348](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/348))
- Cope with renames of the custom plot builder fields. ([GH-346](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/346))

## Version 1.9.3 — 2025-08-24

Changed:

- Filename of export ZIP archive has a more meaningful name. ([GH-344](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/344))
- Make time series column titles all title case.

Fixed:

- Accept floating point numbers as heart rate in GPX files. ([GH-342](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/342))
- Fix documentation about `--strava-begin` parameter. ([GH-343](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/343))
- Specify UTC timezone as uppercase. ([GH-340](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/340))

## Version 1.9.2 — 2025-08-11

Fixed:

- Also filter out zero speed values, which can only come from errors. ([GH-333](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/333))
- Cope with GPX files that have points but none with latitude/longitude information. ([GH-334](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/334))

## Version 1.9.1 — 2025-08-05

Fixed:

- Compute Eddington number using local time zone. ([GH-336](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/336))
- Show local time in search table.
- Use local time for statistics and plots. ([GH-323](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/323))
- Accept negative latitude or longitude, fixes explorer tile pop-up for southern and western hemispheres. ([GH-335](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/335))

## Version 1.9.0 — 2025-07-21

Added:

- Add a bit more logging for Strava API import. ([GH-329](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/329))
- Extract heart rate and cadence from Garmin GPX files. ([GH-327](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/327))
- Allow to upload multiple activities at the same time. ([GH-332](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/332))

Fixed:

- Add another time zone localization. ([GH-331](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/331))
- Remove speed spikes that stem from data points with the same time stamp. ([GH-328](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/328)), ([GH-333](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/333))

## Version 1.8.3 — 2025-07-15

Fixed:

- Use database to see whether Strava activities were already imported. ([GH-321](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/321))

## Version 1.8.2 — 2025-07-15

Fixed:

- Rename `Activity.start_local` to `Activity.start_utc` like it should have been named from the beginning. ([GH-325](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/325))

Fixed:

- Check whether `first_visit` and `last_visit` are `None` before checking the time zone. ([GH-309](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/309))

## Version 1.8.0 — 2025-07-13

This release should have been a patch release (1.7.2), unfortunately I realized this too late. Removing or yanking a release causes more trouble than it is worth.

Changed:

- Update documentation for Strava to include the `--strava-begin` and `--strava-end` command line options. ([GH-296](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/296))

## Version 1.7.1 — 2025-07-13

Fixed:

- Before importing activities via the Strava API, make sure that they don't already exist. ([GH-296](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/296))

## Version 1.7.0 — 2025-07-13

Added:

- Add `--strava-begin` and `--strava-end` command line options. ([GH-296](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/296))
- Add more debug output for timezone handling in tile history. ([GH-309](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/309))

Changed:

- Remove duplicate queries to all activities, should speed up summary statistics, search and hall of fame.

Fixed:

- Rotate photos according to their EXIF rotation tag. ([GH-322](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/322))
- Use local time zone for statistics. ([GH-323](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/323))
- Make tile history consistency check more robust against routes.
- Attempt to unpack FIT tuples to handle enhanced speed and elevation. ([GH-299](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/299))
- Work around bytes in calories field. ([GH-307](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/307))
- Make tile visit consistency robust against deleted activities.

## Version 1.6.0 — 2025-07-13

Added:

- Bring back the progress bar for activity import.

- Add documentation about digital elevation models and their problems.

Fixed:

- Fix photo date extraction by using `strptime` again. ([GH-304](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/304))
- Replace `api.geotimezone.com` with the `timezonefinder` such that finding the time zone from coordinates doesn't need an external service. That service was unavailable due to a TLS certificate expiry and caused disruption. ([GH-319](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/319))
- Ensure that time series are localized to UTC before extracting tile visits. ([GH-309](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/309))
- If the FIT field `enhanced_speed` is a tuple, it is just ignored now. ([GH-299](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/299))

## Version 1.5.2 — 2025-07-12

Fixed:

- Fixed broken explorer tiles when zooming in a lot. That was broken again.

## Version 1.5.1 — 2025-07-12

Fixed:

- Catch `TypeError` as well as `ValueError`. ([GH-307](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/307))

## Version 1.5.0 — 2025-07-12

Added:

- Add explorer tile color strategy for missing tiles.
- List tile URLs on explorer page. ([GH-245](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/245))

Changed:

- Use 255 instead of 256 as a denominator for colors. Shouldn't make any noticeable difference, though.

Fixed:

- Use UTC time for photo upload. ([GH-304](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/304))
- Catch more exceptions during GPX import. ([GH-301](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/301))

Fixed:

- Fixed broken explorer tiles when zooming in a lot.

## Version 1.4.0 — 2025-07-11

Added:

- Show Python version in the footer.
- Add message about importer thread being done.
- Add `inspect-photo` entrypoint for debugging.
- Add some debug output when `idxmax` cannot be taken. ([GH-307](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/307))

Changed:

- Explorer tiles are rendered as overlay, this makes the tiles use as overlays elsewhere. ([GH-245](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/245))
- Heatmap is rendered as overlay, can be used externally as well.

Fixed:

- Fix enabling new zoom level for explorer.
- Recompute cluster and square evolution if chronological order gets broken. ([GH-313](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/313))
- Ignore activities with errors in the Strava checkout importer. ([GH-301](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/301))
- Automatically reset tile history when it doesn't have time zones yet. ([GH-309](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/309))
- Take EXIF time zone into account when importing images. ([GH-304](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/304))
- Fix "first visit" explorer tile color strategy in presence of routes.

## Version 1.3.2 — 2025-07-11

Added:

- Support Python 3.10 again.

Removed:

- Disable Copernicus DEM because the dependencies have caused conflicts, restrict to Python ≥ 3.11 and the value proposition is questionable.

## Version 1.3.1 — 2025-07-10

Added:

- Add debug output in case of weird FIT file import issues. ([GH-301](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/301))

Changed:

- Run explorer tile evolution directly when importing such that one can use all features right after importing the first activity.
- Use URL encode to safely encode the activity names to file paths in the Strava checkout converter. ([GH-298](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/298))

Fixed:

- New activities get a UUID assigned and saved. ([GH-310](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/310))
- Fix module import on Strava import. ([GH-306](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/306))
- Make date optional in activity show such that routes can be displayed. ([GH-311](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/311))
- Pin `tifffile` version to exactly 2025.5.10. ([GH-308](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/308))
- Skip files without suffixes such that stray files don't halt the process. ([GH-301](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/301))

## Version 1.3.0 — 2025-07-07

Added:

- Obtain elevation data from [Copernicus Digital Elevation Model](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/copernicus-contributing-missions/collections-description/COP-DEM) (DEM). This will be used as a fall-back in case there is no recorded data. The DEM model files are downloaded anonymously from Amazon AWS in tiles of 1° latitude/longitude (covering an area with roughly 100 km side length). Unfortunately the data has its own accuracy problem, hence it is not used instead of measured data yet.
- Query external API for time zone at given coordinates such that times can be shown in the local time zone of the activity. ([GH-303](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/303))
- Added a time zone fixer tool which allows to reinterpret the times of already imported activities. ([GH-158](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/158))

Changed:

- Move importing into separate thread to speed-up startup. Importing then runs in the background.
- Import new activities with less steps, get rid of intermediate parsed representations.
- After every imported activity, run the whole processing. This means that one can directly use heatmap and cluster while more activities are importing. ([GH-300](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/300))
- Store times as UTC again. They are displayed in the local time zone of the activity in most places. In plots they are shown in the browser time zone for the time being. The search table has them in UTC.
- Store activity time series with a UUID filename. This makes importing activities robust against crashes or shutdowns of the webserver.

Fixed:

- During a development version, there was an issue with the Strava API. That's fixed. ([GH-305](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/305))

Removed:

- ⚠️ Support for Python 3.10 is now dropped, you need at least Python 3.11.

## Version 1.2.0 — 2025-06-20

Added:

- Support to upload multiple photos at once. ([GH-293](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/293))
- Add config UI to change map tile source. ([GH-194](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/194))

Changed:

- Use consistent emoji string to describe activities on landing page and hall of fame.

Fixed:

- Fix error when search results are empty.
- Fix calls to `vega_direct` on equipment page.
- Fix rounding issue on hall of fame. ([GH-292](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/292))

## Version 1.1.0 — 2025-06-17

Added:

- The plot builder now supports grouping on top of the previous features.
- Add an edit button to custom plots on the summary statistics page.
- Bring back the colorful cluster coloring mode and make that the default.
- Expose default cluster coloring mode via `config.json` option `cluster_color_strategy`, web UI settings menu might follow later.

Changed:

- The plots on the summary page have been re-done. They are now all available not only for distance and elevation gain, but also for elapsed and moving time, energy (calories) and steps.
- Move "Hall of Fame" into separate page.
- The files in `/static` are organized a little better, no change for the user.
- Use tabs on the entry page to organize plots for distance and elevation gain.
- Add breadcrumbs to plot builder edit page.

Fixed:

- Fix summary page when routes are present. ([GH-282](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/282))
- Fix opacity in parametric plots.
- Fix download of explored or missing tiles from the explorer tile view.

## Version 1.0.0 — 2025-06-14

Added:

- Add export feature for activities and metadata. ([GH-246](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/246))
- Add tooltip to server-side explorer tiles. ([GH-243](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/243))
- Add developer documentation about Alembic migrations.
- Write a bit more about the acknowledgments.

Changed:

- Make “fast explorer tile mode” much prettier, mark cluster and square.
- Update quad tree picture with a less intrusive watermark.

Removed:

- Old explorer mode with client-side rendering is now deprecated as the server-side mode has the same features.  ([GH-243](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/243))

Fixed:

- Uploading an activity with a filename that already exists gives an error message. Before it would overwrite the source activity file but not scan it again. ([GH-289](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/289))
- Fix search in cases that only routes (and no tracks) could be found.
- Fix “date before” filter. This was broken due to a mixed-up comparison and effectively acted as a second “date after” filter. ([GH-290](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/290))
- Add a proper redirect on login such that one directly gets back to the page that one wanted to access.

## Version 0.45.0 — 2025-06-08

Added:

- Add config option `reliable_elevation_measurements` (defaulting to true) that allows hiding the elevation gain data if the user knows that their measurement of elevation data is unreliable.

Fixed:

- Saving privacy zones now works again. ([GH-287](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/287))
- Fix redirect after uploading a new activity. ([GH-286](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/286))
- Fix filter application to heatmap. ([GH-285](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/285))
- Attempt to fix equipment and summary page when activities without date are present. ([GH-282](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/282))
- Set unknown equipment in Strava Checkout import to “Unknown”. ([GH-275](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/275))
- Fix Eddington number computation. ([GH-279](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/279))

## Version 0.44.0 — 2025-05-24

Added:

- Add delete button for activities (with an “Are you sure?” confirmation). ([GH-278](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/278))
- Add user defined colors for activity tags. ([GH-276](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/276))
- Add download of original file (after login). ([GH-271](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/271))

Fixed:

- Fix adding of new activity kind. ([GH-270](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/270))
- Gracefully handle case when no activity kinds are considered for achievements but no prior tiles have been extracted. ([GH-274](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/274))

## Version 0.43.2 — 2025-05-06

Fixed:

- Allow POST request to `/settings/admin-password`. ([GH-269](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/269))

## Version 0.43.1 — 2025-05-06

Fixed:

- Handle NaT (not a time) values gracefully. ([GH-268](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/268))
- Make entry page robust against routes without a start.
- Make search page robust against routes without time information.
- Make activity page robust against missing tiles. ([GH-261](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/261))
- Make activity page robust against routes. ([GH-266](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/266))
- Enforce that at least one activity kind is considered for achievements. ([GH-261](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/261))

## Version 0.43.0 — 2025-04-27

Added:

- Add photo upload that matches photos automatically to activities. Photos are shown on the activity page and also on the map for each activity. There is a global map with all photos. ([GH-247](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/247))
- Add tag filter to search form. ([GH-242](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/242))
- Mention CubeTrek on page with similar projects.

Changed:

- The search queries work directly against the database.
- Remove some redundant metadata from the activity overview.

Fixed:

- Filter not-a-time dates when importing into the database. ([GH-266](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/266))

Removed:

- Search history is broken for now.

## Version 0.42.0 — 2025-04-26

Added:

- Add page to documentation about similar projects.
- Add more detailed error message when activity import failed. ([GH-266](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/266))
- Allow setting tags for activities. There is a separate tag manager in the settings panel. Search is still missing. ([GH-242](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/242))
- Add search filter for activity distance. ([GH-267](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/267))

Fixed:

- Iterate over activities in temporal order. This could have lead to screwed up explorer tile history. Delete `Cache/tile-state-2.pickle` and `Cache/work-tracker-tile-state.pickle` to regenerate that part as needed.
- Try to be more robust with NaN values when importing activities. ([GH-266](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/266))
- Fix database directory when using a relative basedir. ([GH-256](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/256))

Removed:

- Remove dict based access to `Activity` class.

## Version 0.41.0 — 2025-04-20

Added:

- Add "elevation Eddington number" page, which shows an Eddington number but with elevation instead of distance. ([GH-254](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/254))
- In the activity view, there is a map with a colored track line. The coloring was based only on speed, now it can also show elevation. ([GH-254](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/254))
- On the landing page there is a plot with the elevation gain in the past weeks. ([GH-254](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/254))
- Add a fast server-side rendering mode for explorer tiles. This is much faster with arbitrary many explored tiles, it just doesn't show nice metadata yet. This can also be used as a tile source for external planning tools. ([GH-243](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/243))
- Add data model for tags, though no user interface yet.

Changed:

- Use database to populate entry page.
- Make explorer tile page load much faster.

Fixed:

- Fix startup without activities. ([GH-263](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/263))

## Version 0.40.1 — 2025-04-18

Fixed:

- Fix moving time for activities with zero elapsed time or moving time. ([GH-260](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/260))
- Handle `/` in activity name when converting from Strava. ([GH-259](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/259))

Removed:

- Remove “commute” concept from Strava converter. ([GH-259](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/259))

## Version 0.40.0 — 2025-04-18

Added:

- Add a plot builder. ([GH-258](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/258))

Changed:

- Rename “altitude” to “elevation”. _Altitude_ describes the height between ground and something in the sky, _elevation_ describes the hight of a point of earth with respect to sea level. Hence for our outdoor activities, “elevation” is more fitting. ([GH-253](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/253))

Fixed:

- Use `pathlib` to construct database path correctly on Windows. ([GH-256](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/256))
- Try to support German localization in Strava conversion. ([GH-259](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/259))
- Fix moving time for activities without duration. ([GH-260](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/260))

## Version 0.39.1 — 2025-04-17

Fixed:

- Fix import of activities into database. ([GH-257](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/257))


## Version 0.39.0 — 2025-04-15

Added:

- Add trim feature for activities, although the user interface is quite basic at the moment. ([GH-234](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/234))
- Add a plot for monthly equipment usage. ([GH-251](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/251))
- Add bubble chart with activities. ([GH-252](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/252))
- Add installation instructions for macOS. ([GH-235](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/235))
- Add link to changelog from the version string. ([GH-244](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/244))
- Add documentation for noisy elevation gain.
- README file now contains much more content. ([GH-250](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/250))
- Add bookmark function for the square planner. ([GH-210](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/210))

Changed:

- ⚠️ The program now stores actual state in the directory and not merely caches the parsed data. This means that one can make changes to the data within the web interface and that will be stored in the database and not in the original files. This is a change in scope of the program so far, which has been only a mere viewer. Data is now stored in a database (SQLite) instead of a Parquet file. Deleting the `Cache` directory will not result in data loss, but deleting `database.sqlite` will.
- Make all tables responsive. ([GH-233](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/233))
- Suggest to upgrade with `--pip-args "--upgrade-strategy eager"` to get the latest versions of dependencies as well.
- Display activities from the past 30 days on the landing page, grouped by day.
- Only show relevant data on the activity page.
- The split between controllers and blueprints is removed, making the code less complex at the cost of not separating code from the web framework. ([GH-214](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/214))
- Settings pages for equipment offsets and activity kinds to consider for achievements have been converted into management pages for equipments and activity kinds.

Removed:

- Deleting an activity file from the `Activities` directory will not remove them from the database any more.
- Remove “commute” property as it is unclear what that even means and what to do with that.

  - Maximum heart rate for heart rate zones
  - Metadata extractions from paths
  - Privacy zones
  - Strava connection

Changed:

- Let the Strava Checkout importer set the file `strava-last-activity-date.json` which is needed such that the Strava API importer can pick up after all the activities that have been imported via the checkout. ([GH-128](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/128))
- Use custom CSV parser to read activities that have newlines in their descriptions. ([GH-143](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/143))
- Only pre-compute explorer maps for zoom 14 and 17 by default. Other ones just have to be enabled once. This saves a bit of computing time for most people that don't need to go down to zoom 19. ([GH-149](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/149))
- The `config.json` replaces the `config.toml` and will automatically be generated.

Fixed:

## Version 0.26.3 — 2024-08-08

Fixed:

- Require `pandas >= 2.2.0` to make sure that it knows about `include_groups`. ([GH-142](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/142))
- Ignore activities without time series when using the Strava Checkout import. ([GH-144](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/144))

- Make calories and steps optional for the share picture. ([GH-127](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/127))

Changed:

- Restructure the way that activities are imported to realize a couple of benefits:
  - Deleting activities is detected now, they are removed from the heatmap.
  - If the code is changed, not everything has to be parsed again. This is especially helpful with regard to the rate-limited Strava API.
  - Some code is deduplicated that had accumulated between activity file parsing and the Strava API.
  - Unfortunately it means that everything needs to parsed again into the new format. I'm sorry about that, especially to you Strava users that need to deal with the rate limiting!
- Update to the column names in the Strava export. ([GH-131](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/131))

Fixed:

- Cope with manually recorded activities in Strava export. ([GH-133](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/133))

- Remove duplicate link to landing page from navigation.

Fixed:

- Fix startup from empty cache. A cache migration assumed that `activities.parquet` exists. I've added a check. ([GH-123](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/123))

## Version 0.23.0 — 2024-06-22

Added:

- Use Flask “flash” messages.
- Support routes that don't have time information attached them. That might be useful if you haven't recorded some particular track but still want it to count towards your heatmap and explorer tiles. ([GH-110](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/110))

Security:

- Add password protection for upload. ([GH-111](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/111))

- Parsing of activity files is now parallelized over all CPU cores and faster than before.

Changed:

- ⚠️ New way to extract metadata from paths and filenames. This uses regular expressions and is more versatile than the heuristic before. If you have used `prefer_metadata_from_file` before, see the documentation on activity files for the new way.
- Ignore similar activities that have vanished. ([GH-105](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/105))
- Be more strict when identifying jumps in activities. Take 30 s and 100 m distance as criterion now. ([GH-106](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/106))
- Better error message when trying to start up without any activity files. ([GH-109](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/109))

- Also accept boolean values in commute column of Strava's `activities.csv`. ([GH-98](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/98))

Changed:

- Take time jumps into account in activity distance computation and the various plots of the activities. ([GH-90](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/90))
- Keep identity of activities based on hash of the file content, not the path. This allows to rename activities and just update their metadata, without having duplicates. ([GH-92](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/92))
- Skip Strava export activities that don't have a file. ([GH-99](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/99))
- Protect fingerprint computation from bogus values ([GH-100](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/100))
- Make dependency on `vegafusion[embed]` explicit in the dependencies. ([GH-102](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/102))

Fixed:

- Fix failure to import Strava distance stream due to `unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'list' and 'int'`. ([GH-88](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/88))
- Delete old pickle file before moving the new one onto it to get it working on Windows. ([GH-103](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/103))

- Add option `--skip-strava` to the `serve` command in order to start the webserver without reaching out to Strava first. This might be useful if the rate limit has been exceeded.
- Attempt to also read Strava exports that are localized to German, though untested. ([GH-86](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/86))
- Add a square planner. ([GH-36](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/36))

- Refactor some paths into a module such that there are not so many redundant definitions around. ([GH-89](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/89))

Fixed:

- Fix confusion about the internal data type for distance. Most of the time it was in meter, but the display was always in kilometer. In order to make it more clear now, the internal data now only contains the field `distance_km` and everything is represented as kilometer internally now. ([GH-88](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/88))

## Version 0.17.5 — 2024-01-14

Fixed:

- Convert FIT sport type enum to strings. [GH-84](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/84)

## Version 0.17.4 — 2024-01-14

Changed:

- Try to use charset-normalizer to figure out the strange encoding. [GH-83](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/83)

## Version 0.17.1 — 2024-01-13

Added:

- From FIT files we also extract the _grade_, _temperature_ and _GPS accuracy_ fields if they are present. There is no analysis for them yet, though. Also extract the workout name, sport and sub-sport fields from FIT files. [GH-81](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/81)
- Add more logging to diagnose Unicode issue on macOS. [GH-83](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues/83)

- Localize SimRa files to local time zone. [GH-80](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/80)
- Parse speed unit from FIT file. There are many devices which record in m/s and not in km/h, yielding too low speeds in the analysis. This is now fixed. [GH-82](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/82)
- Skip `.DS_Store` files in the activity directory. [GH-81](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/pull/81)
